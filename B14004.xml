            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Eeting with a little Pamphlet written by way of Dialogue, and intituled <hi>A Tongue-combate,</hi> professing to containe a true Discourse of these Warres in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> betwixt the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> and the <hi>States Generall,</hi> I could not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injurie to Truth, permit so many falshoods (as vnder colour of sinceritie and modesty, were wrapt vp in those waste-papers, to bee vented for rich commodities vpon our Coast, greedie of nouelties) to passe without question or contradiction. The euer-liuing honour of my late Soueraigne deceased, vnder whose blessed Gouernment I was borne, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in traduced: The justice and prudencie of my dread Soueraigne now raigning, therein obliquely and apertly aymed at: The truth of the Reformed Religion, wherin I was educated, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in oppugned: The loyaltie and reputation of this Nation whom I serue, and for whose just cause I fight, therein defamed; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked me to say what I could, and what I knew, in defence of all. And I am fitted and furnished the better to say something to purpose in this point, both by the many yeeres experience I haue had in the Seruice, as also through the manifold discourses I haue often heard, wherein this businesse haue beene diuersly debated; but especially by the many bookes I haue read and translated touching this Subject, for the satisfaction of my selfe and some honorable friends, who are knowne to be too religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to enter into courses doubtfull or questionable; at least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to warres openly wicked and vnwarrantable. Now being thus fully and clearely resolued in mine owne conscience, I could
<pb facs="tcp:177717:3"/> not but indeuour to resolue others, who might bee doubtfull, and so seeke satisfaction. It is my duty (I take it) to doe thus; for my meanes I receiue of the <hi>States</hi> obligeth my tongue, hand, heart, and whole man, to promote their just cause in wordes, waitings, actions, prayers. He is a traytor (as I iudge) to these, to the truth, to his owne, and to himselfe, that doeth not thus thinke, speake, write, and doe, hauing the same ingagements, where occasion is presented. It concernes all Sword-men to sticke to mee, and to vindicate the honour of our deceased Queene, or present Soueraigne, Religion, the Brittish Nation in generall, and our Worthies in particular, who are made, by this blind and bold bayard, abettors of Rebels and Traytours; whereby theirs and our honours are stayned, our Armes defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the memorable workes of Warre which wee haue wrought for these fiftie yeeres continuance, cast away in obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and contempt; nay, condemned as ignoble crimes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and injustice. Assuredly, he that will not exchange a word with an enemie in this case, for this <hi>State</hi> and the <hi>Truth,</hi> which they and we professe in common, is not to bee trusted in actuall disputations, where blowes and bullets are exchanged, and questions of life and death are agitated and controuerted.</p>
            <p>If any man thinke my style too sharpe, they must consider I am a Souldier, trayned vp from my youth, to haue my sword also as sharpe in this quarrell: besides, I am exceedingly prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by a craftie Aduersarie, who vsing mildnesse and modestie to <hi>Tavvny-scarfe</hi> his owne fained creature, his Puppet, his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, ouer whom hee insults, as vpon a vaulting-horse lowe enough for his leape, is yet most bitter against the <hi>States Generall,</hi> and their instruments, who intertaine and employ the true <hi>Tavvny scarfes,</hi> that will not be so easily baffeled. These he cals Rebels; and for this I often oppose him with the tearmes of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie and Oppression: The successe and Gods blessing vpon these Warres, hauing giuen him the lye, and sealed mee a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique warrant to say more in this case, with authoritie and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of truth.</p>
            <p>This I dedicate to you, who haue beene a noble instrument in these just Warres for many yeeres past, and will (I doubt not) deigne to protect my Pen, which doth but repeate that which
<pb facs="tcp:177717:3"/> your hands hath written with bloud, and carued in large chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters vpon the wounded bodies of diuers braue &amp; bold Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites. It is now a time or neuer to declare our selues, and stand together for the truth of Religion herein oppugned: which hee that shrinkes from, for any worldly or politicke respect, or any Antichristian ayme, and temporarie temptation, shall surely be denyed hereafter of Christ Iesus, who will publiquely professe <hi>to be ashamed of them before God, vvho are ashamed of him here before men;</hi> and to spue those luke warme persons out of his mouth, whom the sudden and vnexpected alarum of bold, daring, and desperate opposition for Falshood, will not awaken from that stupide Lethargie, or reserued Foxe-sleepe of Policie, wherein they lye bed-rid, to be <hi>as couragious for Truth, as other men are for lyes,</hi> in this Age of Atheisme.</p>
            <p>The Lord by his Spirit kindle this zeale in our hearts for his Cause, and honour the militarie Profession so farre, that as <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> the <hi>Priest,</hi> hath heretofore taken his Pike, and led vs by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, to execute vengeance on Gods foes that would corrupt others; so <hi>vvee</hi> may now leade <hi>Phineas</hi> against that <hi>Babylonish Strumpet</hi> and her Brood, who <hi>commits fornication vvith the greatest Princes of the earth,</hi> and would impudently presse into our Tents, to doe, and cause the like villanie to be openly and vniuersally committed by vs and all men.

            </head>
            <p>IN my late passage downe from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Grauesend</hi> by <hi>Tilt-boate,</hi> there chanced among others, two Gentlemen at that present also to passe, being both of military profession, but indifferently disposed in their determinations, touching the Sides they went to serue on: for after some course of speech that passed among the companie, the one discouered his intention to goe ouer into the <hi>Netherlands</hi> to serue the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the other manifested his purpose to goe serue the <hi>States of Holland:</hi> but because each of them seemed fortified vvith reason for his determination, and to thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe aswell able to defend it, as hee seemed willing to follow it, all the company, out of a curiositie, were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry desirous to heare what by either side could bee sayd; but yet with a prouiso, that no inconueniencie or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out betweene them vpon it might ensue; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they desired them, that before they began seriously to argue the matter, they should passe their words to each other vpon their honours, that without injuring one another in particular, each might haue his free speech in defence of his owne determined course; and that their arguing being ended, there should no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be taken either by them, or any of the companie,
<pb facs="tcp:177717:4"/> for ought that had beene spoken; but that both they, and all the rest of the companie, (their discourse beeing ended) should in ciuill and courteous manner carrie themselues, and so take their leaues of each other, when their wayes lay to be separated. To this all agreed, and these twaine gaue each other their hand vpon the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and thereupon began betweene them a <hi>Tongue-combate,</hi> wherein neither of both were slaine or mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: and because it may be some recreation vnto you, to vnderstand how the matter passed, I thought good now at my soonest leysure, and aswell as my memorie would permit me, to pen it downe, and to present it to your view, to whom I hold my best indeuours obliged. And this kissing your hands, I take my leaue, wishing vnto you the atchieuing of all honour, answerable vnto your noble valour and courage.</p>

I found also a Dedication fixed to the Front of your Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, as if you meant to make your best friend sharer of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you atchieued by the supposed victorie ouer mee.

<pb facs="tcp:177717:5"/> because I saw you did not onely wrong mee, by concealing what I said, and affirming what I neuer sayd, but laboured also to wrong the cause, through the weaknesse of my person.

As for that which hee saith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the names of the Disputants, that he knew them not, and therefore was forced to call one <hi>Red-scarfe,</hi> the other <hi>Tawny-scarfe,</hi> according to the colour of their Scarfes, must thus be vnderstood; that indeed he knew not my name, and for his owne, being a man of many names, he knew not which to assume for that instant, but that some of the companie might haue knowne him by another, worne in some other place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did wisely dye himselfe into red; which being in graine, will without blushing warrant any falshood, and outface any truth. This I let thee know also, that hee began the Combate, though he giues mee the honour to charge; and that hee retired somewhat confusedly in the end, though he saith (falsely) that I ran away. This shall be sufficient for a touch, and to giue thee warning of the rest, how warily thou art to beleeue him.</p>

               <p>It seemeth strange vnto me, that any of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen should rather resolue to serue the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> then the <hi>States of Holland,</hi> considering how long their Cause and Quarrell had beene by <hi>Englishmen</hi> supported, and the number of our Countrimen that continue to serue on that <hi>Side.</hi>

               <p>It seemeth as strange vnto me, that men of sense and vnderstanding should not rather regard the iustnesse of the Cause and Quarrell which they are to defend, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they are not constrained, but that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution lyeth in their owne choyce) then to let them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues be blind-folded and led forward by sinister sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, to follow the vn-understanding vulgar Multitude
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:177717:6"/> for companie or custome sake, because they haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued so long a time to serue on that <hi>Side,</hi> without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or caring wherein right or wrong consisteth.</p>

               <p>As for your company, assure your selfe I seeke it not: vve haue too many already that vve cannot trust. And for perswading you to see and be sorrie for your error, it is in vaine for me to hope to worke such a miracle. I know right well, the bright Sunne makes Moles the more blinde; and such as you, who (I feare) haue scared and peruerted consciences, wil sooner beleeue lyes then truth: so that all the euidence I shall bring to cleare this point, vvill but make you the more obstinate and vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and I might hope to draw you farther with a fained Legend, then vvith lines drawne from the Booke of life it selfe. Yet since you desire to trie your strength, (for I know you are armed and studied to oppose) I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:177717:7"/> three reasons, inducing Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of happy Memorie, to assist the <hi>States Generall</hi> in these warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King of <hi>Spayne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1 The first, vvas the oppression and vvrong done them by the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> both in violating their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and laudable Lawes, Priuiledges, and Liberties, (euen such as vvere fundamentall, vpon vvhich the State stood as vpon a base) as also in tyrannizing ouer their consciences by a most bloody and barbarous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The second reason was, because they vvere our old sure friends, and had bin so, before they had Earles, much more before the <hi>Spanish</hi> Title in those Parts; and vve desired still to keepe them our neere neighbours, rather then to change them for new friends, more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote both in affection and manners, vvhose propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity vve desired not, beholding it dangerous to <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, Naples,</hi> and all other Nations, as ayming at an <hi>vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Monarchy.</hi> Especially Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> saw the perill, so great a neighbour might bring to Her and her State, vvhen shee and her Kingdomes onely lay as a blocke in the vvay, to breake the necke of His intended Greatnesse.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The third motiue and the greatest, which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went matter of State, vvas the maintenance of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and peaceable state of the true reformed Church, which began there to inlarge it selfe; and whereof as shee vvas styled, so shee intended to prooue her selfe (and performed what she intended) <hi>A true Desendresse of the Faith.</hi>

               <p>You haue here alledged sundry reasons to haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:177717:8"/> Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to take the <hi>Hollanders</hi> parts, it is reason then, that if so be I cannot allow them for suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reasons, I prooue them not so to bee, vvhich by your patience and permission I shall be able to doe.</p>
               <p>The first point is about their being oppressed and vvronged by the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and in danger to bee brought vnder the seueritie of a <hi>Spanish Inquisition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That these people liued in obedience of King <hi>Philip</hi> the second of <hi>Spayne,</hi> as did all other the inhabitants of the seuenteene <hi>Netherland Prouinces,</hi> acknowledging him as their true and lawfull Soueraigne Lord, as they had acknowledged his Ancestors before him, from vvhom hee successiuely inherited those Countries, no man can make any doubt or question. The question then is, whether this King, when hee came to the possession of those Countries, did impose vpon the people any pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, more then his former Ancestors had done; but who is able to shew that he did? the said King beeing then in as full and quiet possession of all those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as euer any of his Ancestors had beene; and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from thence into <hi>Spaine</hi> in the yeere <hi>1559.</hi> hee left none of his Netherland subiects, for any cause of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, in any thing any whit disgusted, but in as great tranquilitie as euer they had beene. He left behind him in those Countries no Spanish Gouernours nor souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but gaue the particular Gouernments to the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the Country it selfe, and the generall Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them all, vnto his naturall sister the Duchesse of <hi>Parma,</hi> beeing of the same Countrey borne: vvhat wrong in any respect was here done them? vvho com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of any wrong? why was not the good peace and reciprocall loue betwixt this King and his Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:177717:8"/> subiects continued? who began the breach? what actions of innouation caused it? proceeded it from this Prince, or from the Netherland people?</p>
               <p>When no thought or cogitation was in this Kings minde of any breach betweene him and his subiects, in the yeere of our Lord <hi>1566.</hi> certaine of the rascalitie beeing suggested by sedicious Preachers, and those Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers set on by some of the Nobilitie, little better then bankrupt, they began in most rebellious rage, to fall to the robbing and spoyling of Churches. The Duchesse of <hi>Parma</hi> being at <hi>Bruxels</hi> vvhen the newes of this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious and generall sacrilegious theft vvas brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, was much amazed thereat, and demanded of the Earle of <hi>Barlamont,</hi> (who then was present) what they vvere that had done this, vvhereunto hee answered her in French, <hi>Ceste sont que de Geus,</hi> vvhich as much to say, <hi>they are but Rogues or Rascals.</hi> The Church-robbers, and those that set them on worke, vvhereof some vvere Gentlemen, (though much vnworthy of that title) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gotten notice how the name of <hi>Geus</hi> was giuen them, did foorthwith accept of the name, and wore in stead of brooches on their hats, little woodden dishes, to betoken beggars dishes; and some of that sort did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards weare Foxe tailes in their Hats in stead of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; so as it seemeth they tooke a glorie in this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy name: for they also caused a print or stampe of a Cocke to be made, at whose mouth the words <hi>Viue les Geus par tout le monde</hi> were set downe, vvhich is as much to say, <hi>Liue, or flourish may the Rogues ouer all the world:</hi> and the paper-prints or pictures taken from this stamp, were set vp in all houses, taphouses, and tauernes where they frequented: herehence it commeth, that in all the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:177717:9"/> Low-countries, this kinde of people doe vnto this day, beare the name of <hi>Geuses,</hi> howbeit they haue since beene taught to call themselues <hi>the Reformed,</hi> but Protestants they neither doe, nor euer did call themselues.</p>
               <p>Here haue you the originall and beginning of the breach betweene the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and these his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therland subiects; and as touching their beeing oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and wronged by the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and in danger to be brought vnder the seueritie of the <hi>Spanish Inquisition,</hi> the blame that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> herein deserueth is, that he was so much ouer-shot, that when hee heard of their breaking downe of Altars and Images in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, of their robbing and carying thence of siluer Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices, Paternes, Cruets, Candlestickes, Lampes, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquaries, with the Tapestrie, and whatsoeuer they might make money of, euen to the very Bels in the Steeples, he had not commended it to be wel done, and sent them rewards for their so doing, and so haue let them runne on euen to the taking of the Crucifixe out of the Church, and hanging it on the Gallowes, as they did at <hi>Gorcum</hi> in <hi>Holland;</hi> an act, that albeit the Diuell, Iewes, and Geuses would take pleasure in, yet would ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Turkes, and Mahometans bee scandalized to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it.</p>
               <p>Now because the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> had sworne at his being in the Netherlands, to defend the Church and Ecclesiasticall persons in their auncient and Christian Priuiledges, and that he apprehended Church-robberie to be theft, he so much wronged these people, as to send the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> to punish this theft, which (as I take it) was as little wrong, as to hang a Minister for stealing of a booke of Martyrs out of a Parish Church in <hi>London.</hi>

               <speaker>Tawny-scarfe.</speaker>
               <p>You haue here said something to no purpose: yet first to answere your falshoods, and then to adde that vvhich is true. Your speech consists of two parts: in the one you labour to cleare the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> from all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; in the other, you seeke to cast all the fault vpon the people, and especially vpon those of the <hi>Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> vvhom by the vvay, as farre as your skill will serue you, you spot vvith three or foure crimes, which I dare say, you count proper to the cause.</p>
               <p>First, I vvillingly grant the quiet possession of <hi>Philip</hi> the second King of <hi>Spaine</hi> in those Prouinces, and the generall obedience vvhich the people yeelded to him, during the time of his stay amongst them, all which augments his obligation of loue. But whereas you lay the cause of these ensuing warres, to the rascall multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, sedicious Preachers, and bankrupt Nobilitie (as you style them) you shall finde your owne glorious and Catholique Companie to be these Rascals, your owne Popish Clergie to be the sedicious Priests, your owne bloudie Nobilitie, to be these bankrupts of true Bloud and Nobilitie. For the reprochfull name of <hi>Geus</hi> cast vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, vvhich you interpret <hi>Rascall,</hi> they wore it, and the ensignes and badges of it, as an honour, to let the world see, the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> and his Councell, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Clergie, accounted no better of them, then of Rogues or beggars, and intended with the vtmost speed to make them such, vvhich also they exprest by the woodden dish.</p>
               <p>As for the Foxe taile, vvhich you say, they wore in their Caps, it was perhaps to put you in minde, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they nor their Preachers were such Votaries as your
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:177717:10"/> chaste Friar <hi>Cornelius Adrianson</hi> of <hi>Bruges;</hi> vvho being a most zealous persecuter of the <hi>Geuses,</hi> and very deuoute and obedient to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Catholike King, inuented an Order of humilitie and innocencie, and vsed to vvhip the penitent female soules, that hee confest, with a Foxe-tayle starke naked, telling them it became <hi>Innocencie to bee seene so.</hi> This must needes bee a sore and seuere kinde of Penance both to them and to him; yet not so absurd and abhord, as that Sodomiticall practise of the Friars of <hi>Gant</hi> and <hi>Bruges;</hi> for which much about that time, many were burnt, and many were vvhipt, by the sentence of the Court of <hi>Flanders,</hi> beeing all men of their owne Religion.</p>
               <p>For the hanging vp of a Crucifixe vpon the Gallowes at <hi>Gorcum,</hi> vvherewith you charge the people, I must confesse I allow not of the fact; nay rather I condemne it as an idle and scandalous action, neither can I suppose it true; yet admit it were so, then doubtlesse either it was done by some irreligious persons, who mixed thēselues vvith the multitude of rash Reformers; or if by some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, out of blinde deuotion and indiscreet zeale, they might defend themselues with these reasons, which you can hardly refute.</p>
               <p n="1">1 First, you paint Christ hanged on a Crosse, vvho fits in glory at the right hand of God the Father: for this they hang vp your forgerie; and doe no more indeed in the open ayre, then what you did before by the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sill, vnder the roofe of your owne houses, or in the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, your Masse priests euery day crucifie againe the Lord of life, at least they make such as you beleeue they doe so, vvhilst they offer vp his bodie to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:177717:10"/> God the Father for sinne, as once hee did for all on the Crosse himselfe. But these onely did execute the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, vvhilst your Clergie, like <hi>Caiaphas, Annas, Herod, Pilate,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> betray, accuse, and condemne him eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day in person, as they say, if <hi>hoc est corpus meum,</hi> with a crosse or two added, haue power to change a Cake into Christs bodie.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdly, that Idol rob'd God of his glorie, and Christ of his worship; vvhilst, either it had all or part of that respect, vvhich was due to the person. If then a man for meere necessitie stealing a Surplice, Chalice, Image, or the like, out of your idolatrous Temples, bee vvorthy of hanging, though he bee the image of God, what, is not your Idol worthy to bee hanged, who robs God of his glorie, &amp; your soules of true felicitie? Christ himselfe whipt theeues out of the Church, and shall that theefe be left there? It is your blinde deuotion to preferre that Idol, before the true, liuely, and liuing I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Christ, vvhom you daily hang vp for this Idols sake: and so, whilst you thinke to doe God good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, doe seruice to the Diuell, making <hi>your owne sonnes and daughters passe thorow the fire to Molech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Minister which you bring in by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, who should steale (as you say) a <hi>Booke of Martyrs</hi> out of a Parish Church in <hi>London:</hi> if there were any such man, he was worthy to be hang'd; but suppose hee had stolen your god amighty in the siluer Boxe, (as hee vvas very like to doe it, had it stood in his way) what a pitifull case had you beene in, whilst you must haue pursued him as <hi>Laban</hi> did <hi>Iacob,</hi> saying,<note place="margin">Gen. 31.30.</note>
                  <hi>why haue you stolne away my god?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this for answer to your naked and emptie allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:177717:11"/> which must bee credited vpon your bare word. But whereas you cry out, or rather crow like a Cocke on a dunghill, demanding vvhat wrong in any respect was done the people? <hi>who complained of any wrong? why was not the good peace and reciprocall loue betweene this King and his Netherland subiects continued? who began the breach? what actions of innouation caused it? proceeded it from this Prince, or from the Netherland people?</hi> I will briefly as I may, satisfie all your demands, shewing first the true and naturall constitution of that mixed Gouernement <hi>ab initio,</hi> and then proceeding to manifest what new pressures, contrary to the fundamentall Lawes of the State, and what daily incroachments, stolne vpon the peoples Liberties by policie, prouoked this warre, and produced the dire effects following; as a mirrour to warne all Magistrates to beware of tyrannie, and to bee content with their owne in manly moderation, lest <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi>-like, seeking to become gods, they prooue diuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Tyrants, and so lose their first angelicall seates of Soueraigntie.</p>
               <p>But because it is impossible in so narrow a Discourse as vve intend, to speake of all particulars, and to deliuer seuerally, vvhat euery Prouince, and euery City in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prouince, holds apart from others, as proper onely to themselues, I vvill onely shew you a few of those <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> (rather then <hi>Priuiledges</hi>) of State, vvhich these Nations haue preserued intire in generall, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the many powerfull hands they haue in that time past thorow; when, euen the most noble and generous Nations, vvho boast and glorie of <hi>vniuersall Monarchies,</hi> haue indured in lesse time many violent changes, and a totall and finall losse of their Liberties.</p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:177717:11"/>
               <p>The <hi>Batanians</hi> (for that is the most generall name pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to this people) were originally of the <hi>Cattens,</hi> now called <hi>Hessens;</hi> they first possest the Land which they now hold, without iniurie to any other Nation or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, finding it not inhabited by reason of many wants and inconueniences, vvhich their inuincible industries haue since ouercome; and much of it also not habitable, in regard of sundry difficulties vvhich their admirable inuentions haue since remooued, or conuerted into profitable helpes and necessarie commodities. Thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally they are free vvithout forraine tenure for the place, or complaint of any person for elbow-roome or intrusion. Their Gouernement also was as free as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement could possibly be: they chose their Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours themselues, vvere he one or more, King, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or Earle; and euer had respect that their Liberties and welfares should not rest in the bosome or disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one man onely; but so wisely and warily proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that were he wise or foolish, vertuous or vvicked, va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               <p>For this end also they chose a certaine mixed number of the Nobles and Commons to sit in Councell, whom they called <hi>States Generall;</hi> and in these consisted a great part of the Soueraigntie, at least power to qualifie the ouer-swelling torrent of Tyrannie in the Superiour, and to represse and stay the headstrong and disobedient fury of the inferiour, and to stand in the midst as a Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor betwixt Prince and people, <hi>as our Parliaments in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland vse to doe.</hi>

               <p>You should shew your selfe very wise if you could disprooue it, and very simple till then not to beleeue it, vpon such pregnant proofes as hath or shall bee produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.

               <p>There is no honest nor godly Christian, but abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and is ashamed to doe any iniuries vnto the bodies of the dead; and the buriall of the dead is thought a fit and an honourable thing amongst the Heathens and Barbarians: but the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> caused diuers dead bodies (to spite both God and man) after they had beene buried and lien certaine dayes in the ground; to be dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vp againe, and to bee drawne vnder the Gallowes, and there to be hanged or burnt; alledging, that they died without receiuing the Sacrament, or being confest: but in truth it was done onely, that according to his Proclamation, he might confiscate their goods.</p>
               <p>The state of marriage (the onely foundation of all societie in euery place and Towne, and the bond of loue and peace, the right ground of all good life and conuersation amongst men, which most consisteth in true and right consent) was by the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> broken and disannulled; for that the parties that were married in the <hi>reformed Assemblies,</hi> were held as Heretickes vnlesse they married againe, (which many did) intending therby to bestow the rich women vpon his souldiers for a prise.</p>

               <p>To conclude, he did openly breake and disannull all honest amitie and loue, that one man is bound to shew vnto another, murthering and executing vvomen that holpe their husbands, and children that comforted their parents in their vttermost and greatest extremities, and such as did but comfort them with a Letter; as was to be seene in the towne of <hi>Mastricht,</hi> vvhere the father was cruelly put to death because he lodged his sonne (that he had not seene in a long time before) one night; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, because he gaue a poore widow (vvhose husband had beene put to death for Religion) certaine corne for almes; another, for that he sent certaine money vnto his friend which was then in <hi>England,</hi> and confiscated the goods of many honest and rich women, because they had lodged their husbands in their houses, whereby they were compelled to begge their bread.</p>
               <p>Hee likewise prophaned the holy Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, causing the children that had beene openly and publikely baptized <hi>in the Name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost,</hi> to be baptized againe, because they had beene baptized (as hee said) by Heretickes, vvhich vvas against the Decrees of Councels, and all the Lawes both of God and man.</p>
               <p>To shew his extreme pride and high minde, in the Castle of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> he caused his image to bee made and erected of brasse, (like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>) placing vnder his feet the <hi>Nobilitie and States of the Countries of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands:</hi> and at <hi>Antwerpe</hi> in the market-place, where he published a Pardon, he caused a princely Throne to be erected, which is vsed to be set vp, onely therewith to honour Princes and Kings, which he of himselfe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be set vp and sate thereon, to the diminishing of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:177717:24"/> the Kings honour, vvhich no Lieutenant to the King before him durst attempt.</p>
               <p>This is part of that vvherewith the Countries of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> both of the one and the other Religion doe charge your great and glorious Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> who vvent out of his command like a snuffe in the nostrils of all the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> that loued their Countries li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, howsoeuer they varied in points and opinions of Religion.</p>
               <p>After his departure the King sent the great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of <hi>Castile,</hi> not to moderate any thing of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors tyrannie, but to pursue it more couertly and cunningly. In his time, vnder colour of a mutinie, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twerpe, Bruxels, Mastricht, Alost,</hi> with diuers other places, (beeing then vnder the peaceable gouernement of the King) were surprised by the Spanish Souldiers, ransackt and burnt, as if they had beene townes of enemies, and at last forced to redeeme their owne liberty, by satisfying the Souldier their vnreasonable demands; so vnderhand paying the Kings Army. The Captaine of these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Mutineers was one <hi>Ieronymo de Rhoda</hi> a Priest; who (as it plainely appeares) had secret instructions to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, or pretend Rebellion, or doe, or counterfeit any other falshood, which might impouerish the people, make them vnable to resist any violence, and so faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate the Kings maine end of Conquest, and absolute subiection of those Countries to Tyrannie. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (the great Commander being dead) hee tooke vpon him, by some priuate instruction from <hi>Spaine,</hi> to rule all: whilst notwithstanding by publike Decree the King had established the <hi>Generall Estates</hi> in the Gouernment. But it plainely appeared, the face and heart of these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:177717:25"/> and actions was not all one. For howsoeuer the publike countenance stood for the <hi>States,</hi> the secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was that <hi>Rhoda</hi> should gouerne; which he knowing, vsurped the Kings name, authoritie, and Seale, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into <hi>Spaine</hi> afterward, in stead of punishment, vvas vvell rewarded for it: because, though he crost the publike Act of the King, yet he performed the secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and priuate instruction giuen him. And this vvas manifestly discouered at the comming of <hi>Dom Iohn of Austria</hi> to gouerne, vvho was forbidden to speake, or see <hi>Rhoda,</hi> or giue him any countenance, but to demeane himselfe towards him, as if he had beene an enemy and Rebell, yet vnderhand to carry himselfe in the Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those Countries, onely as he should be directed by the instructions of <hi>Rhoda.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> seemed to hold altogether with the Nobles and with the Countrey, to pitie their pressures, to promise a speedy redresse of all grieuances; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this was but fained to betray them; for hee sought and aymed at the same end that all the rest had done before, though after a new manner; labouring to winne and conquer one part by another, and to diuide the Countries, that he might rule as hee list. All this plot vvas disclosed by the prouidence of God, who (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no <hi>Tyrant,</hi> but a <hi>father</hi> himselfe) is an enemy to all oppression and tyranny; and beeing <hi>Truth it selfe,</hi> hates all dissimulation and falshood: for a Letter of the Kings to <hi>Dom Iohn</hi> was intercepted, wherein all these snares, traines, and plots, vvere amply layd downe and delineated to life, for the better execution of them when time serued. Vpon which, the whole State be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding nothing that might mooue them to hope for
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:177717:25"/> reformation, but vvhat might cause them rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire of faire dealing, they altogether agreed and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to renounce their allegeance to the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> and finally to declare him falne by Tyrannie from the Seignorie, Principalitie, Iurisdiction, and Inheritance of those Countries; vvhich accordingly they did, <hi>Anno</hi> 1581. by publike act.</p>
               <p>And here you see some of the true causes of their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall breaking off from their obedience, and many of the new pressures you so earnestly enquire after; all which you must needes iustifie for reasonable, if you be a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable creature, and haue not the eyes of your vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as well as of your faith, seeled vp with a fether from one of those <hi>Romish Geese</hi> that kept the Capitoll; or put cleane out by the application of <hi>Spanish Catholicon</hi> tempered vvith golden Drugges of the East and West <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For is it not reasonable, that hee who disclaimes his owne interest, vvhich is right and just, though not so large as he desires, and flyes to another vvhich is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to his desire in the extent, though vniust and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, should lose the iust title which he disclaymes, and receiue no manner of benefit from it? In case of tenures (I haue heard) that our Common Law (which is for the most part grounded vpon Reason) sayth; That if a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life seekes to the prejudice of another person, to chalenge a state of Inheritance, and to pleade it; being euicted therein, he loseth his first title, and cannot fall backe to assume that Right vvhich before he disauowed. But you will say, The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> did not disauow his title of Inheritance by birth. I answere, by wordes (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) he did not; but it is plaine, that by ouert acts hee
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:177717:26"/> did, vvhen he sought to <hi>conquer his owne Inheritance;</hi> and so taught the people <hi>to resist him as a common and publike enemie, who sought the subuersion of their fundamentall Lawes and Liberties, and the bondage of their Countrey.</hi> Thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting his owne duty first, hee taught them to forget theirs afterwards; and seeking to inthrall them vniustly, he gaue them a iust cause and ground of farther liberty.</p>

               <p>And vvhereas concerning the originall of the <hi>Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> you say (like a learned Antiquary) it vvas begotten by <hi>Charlemain</hi> the Emperor, vvho liued 800. yeres since, and brought vp in <hi>Germany</hi> not in <hi>Spaine,</hi> but thither ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried onely for the vse of <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Iewes,</hi> and might be profitably (as you say) returned into the <hi>Netherlands</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:177717:27"/> againe, to keepe them from turning <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Iewes,</hi> to vvhich you finde them very prone: I answer in a vvord, that the tyrannies of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and their impure and beastly conuersation, with their abominable Idolatries, doth more scandalize the <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Iewes,</hi> and keepe backe, and driue more of them from the Faith, then can be reuoked by the <hi>Inquisition,</hi> or any other such bloudy course. And me thinkes, it is better, amongst euils, to bee a profest <hi>Turke</hi> or <hi>Iew,</hi> then a counterfeit, cruell, proud, couetous, bloudy and barbarous Christian; <hi>though</hi> (as one saith) <hi>it were better to be no man, then either of both.</hi> Wherfore I would haue a generall <hi>Inquisition</hi> in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of Christendome, onely to finde out such as vvere <hi>hispaniolized</hi> in the Dominions of other Princes; and such would I haue worthily put to the same torments vvhich they inflict vpon others for their consciences. Those <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Iewes</hi> you speake of, vvould I haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted by prayers, disputations, and good examples of vertue and justice: for no man hath sure hold vpon that conscience, which is retained by force from its own choyce and liberty; and therefore you finde fault very wisely, for that euery man may beleeue what hee list in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> as if your holy <hi>Inquisition</hi> had power to make a man beleeue what it list in <hi>Spaine;</hi> you may force men to confesse, perhaps, but you cannot force them to beleeue; which is an action of the will subiect to no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but the force of perswasion, or the holy Spirits motion. And therefore considering what a heauy iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lyes vpon them, and how their eyes, eares, and hearts are seeled and sealed vp, that <hi>they cannot see, heare, and vnderstand,</hi> Rom. 11.9 10, 11, 12. it were rather fit for Christians to pitie them, and pray for their conuersion,

               <p>As for that which you charge diuers of the <hi>Geuses</hi> withall, that they marched vnder an Ensigne whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was depicted the <hi>deuils clawes,</hi> which you oppose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that banner vvith the signe of the Crosse vpon it, borne by <hi>Constantinus Magnus;</hi> I answer, they rather thus correspond; Christs crosse is caried in token that he hath triumphed vpon the Crosse,<note place="margin">Col. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Where free liberty of Conscience is allowed, why may not euery one beleeue as him list? vvhat shall restraine him? if you doubt of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> making difficulty of turning <hi>Turkes,</hi> doe but enquire what they haue done at <hi>Tunis,</hi> where they haue falne to <hi>Mahometisme</hi> by vvhole shipfuls at once; and afterward to mend the matter, haue taught the <hi>Mahometans</hi> of those parts the laudable science of Piracie, for the more affliction of Christians;

               <p>Thus haue I here shewed you what great wrong the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> hath done this people, and what great cause they haue to complaine of his breach of their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges, vvhich is alwayes in their mouthes, albeit they would neuer vouchsafe to produce any old Priuiledge for the robbing of Churches.

You haue had euidence enough, that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> sought to plant a tyranny in the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> and yet lest these should seeme in your eyes, or the like, not to be sufficient, I produce an honorable Ambassage sent from the Archduke <hi>Mathias</hi> and the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Estates,</hi> to a solemne Assembly of the Princes of the Empire, holden at <hi>Wormes</hi> in <hi>Germany, anno</hi> 1578. vvhere the Seignior of <hi>S.

               <p>This then vvas thought sufficient to put all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vpon their guard; and yet all this is not sufficient to make you beleeue any thing, but the golden Legend of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>This also might appeare by the Duke of <hi>Anjous</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the title of the Duke of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> and by the King of <hi>France</hi> his declaration made for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the cause, and conditioning for the title af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of his brother the Duke of <hi>Anjou;</hi> vvhich he would not haue done, being of the <hi>Romish Religion</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, if hee and his wise Councell had not by pregnant proofes seene, that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> by his tyranny and intrusion, was falne from his Right, and had manumis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them from all necessary obedience.</p>
               <p>This lastly is confirmed beyond question, by the last accord made betwixt the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> and these <hi>States,</hi> vvherein the title he had is wholly relinquished; and he treates and concludes peace with them, as with <hi>free States,</hi> to whom he pretends no title; and so entertained their Ambassadours, as the Ambassadours of a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracie. Besides, the King of great <hi>Brittaine, France, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:177717:30"/> Sweden, the State of Venice,</hi> the <hi>Germane</hi> Princes, with other Nations in Christendom &amp; without, haue treated vvith them vpon the same termes, and haue concluded peace, and made leagues and alliances vvith them as vvith free <hi>States,</hi> acknowledging them to bee inuested with soueraigne power in the <hi>vnited Body.</hi> Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is iniustice for the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> to fall backe from his former conclusion, made so aduisedly, and to reuiue his title, as an <hi>immortall cause</hi> of vvarre and bloudshed; yea it is iniustice in you, or any other person, to defend that title by tongue, pen, or hand. For it cals both the vvisedome and honour of our owne King, and of all other Kings, Princes, and States, vvho haue made peace vvith that <hi>State,</hi> into question; yea it censures and condemnes them all; it dissolues all those Leagues and Confederacies of trade and commerce, of warres offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue and defensiue, concluded with them for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good; and sets all Christendome in combustion, with a <hi>Romish squib</hi> of <hi>reseruation,</hi> and <hi>Catholike equiuocation.</hi> And surely, howsoeuer you, and such as you, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerately thinke meanely, and speake basely of the wisest and worthiest persons employed in that <hi>State,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you finde them without traine, or pompe, or titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vanities; and many of them raised for their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, fidelity and vvisedome, from meane stations, to treade in those high steps of authority and superioritie, (as the <hi>Romane</hi> Consuls had vvont, of whom one sayd, <hi>they were all Kings</hi>) yet whatsoeuer is vnfit to bee spoken of other Princes, is vnfit to bee spoken of them in their places; and the iust attributes you giue other high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, ought to be giuen them in their <hi>vnited Body:</hi> And that they exact it not, proceedes from their lenity
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:177717:30"/> and humility; that you giue it not, proceedes from your ignorance, arrogance, malice, and pride. Therefore to conclude this poynt, the scrupulous souldier, vvho be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either vvould not see the truth, or could not iudge it, may now be resolued of the iustice of the warres, euen from the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> owne confession and concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and from the publike acts of his owne Prince and State vvhere he liues. Besides, the miraculous blessing and prosperity which God hath giuen to their warres, shewes <hi>it is of him;</hi> and the policie and power of Princes doth enuie it, and oppose it in vaine. God blesseth them with peace, and plenty, and riches in the midst of warre, and impouerisheth and embroyleth their opposers, in the midst of peace: as <hi>Tantalus</hi> is thirstie with water at the lip, so these beggar and breake at the fountaine head of Gold and Siluer: God by all these meanes confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their cause, and shewing himselfe to be their God, if they will be his people. And this (I thinke) shall serue to satisfie you, at least to silence your further clamour; shewing, that the Queene of <hi>England</hi> was mooued to take the <hi>Netherlands</hi> parts out of meere commiseration of their iust cause, and the detestation of those <hi>Spanish</hi> cruelties and tyrannies vnder which they groned.</p>
               <p>Now if you be not weary of your taske, let vs come to speake of the second reason, inducing that good Queene to succour them; which was, partly domesticke respects, mixed with other important reasons of State; namely, Because of our auncient leagues with that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, our daily commerce and intercourse, the dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of one State vpon another, the assurance of their good and approoued neighbourhood, the feare of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> propinquitie, especially as the case stood with the

               <p>That <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> haue anciently remained in great amity together, Histories and Chronicles wil wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the diuers alliances and marriages often made betweene these two Countries, can also giue testimony thereof.</p>
               <p>True then it is, that the great breach and hostility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> began but in these our dayes: let vs now see and consider, vvhy and how it began; to wit, whether by <hi>Spaine</hi> or by <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> the second of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as all the vvorld knoweth, did vpon the death of Queene <hi>Mary</hi> his wife, giue place and quiet entrance vnto Queene <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and for further proofe of his desire of continuance of peace and amitie with her, hee freely gaue vnto her all Queene <hi>Maries</hi> Iewels, they iustly belonging vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: he also kept his Ambassadour Lidger in <hi>England,</hi> as the said Queene kept hers also in <hi>Spaine,</hi> professing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:177717:31"/> outwardly vnto him all loue and amitie; and yet this notwitstanding shee permitted secretly and vnderhand, the transport of Artillery and Munition of warre to the <hi>Moores</hi> of <hi>Granado,</hi> to enable them to rebell, iust about the very same time, that the <hi>Netherland</hi>-rebellion was determined to be begun, that thereby the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> might haue his hands full, by beeing thrust into two vvares at once; both which shee vnderhand furnished, but more the warre of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> then that of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado,</hi> because of the readier commoditie. Soone vpon the contriuing of this plot, when the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to appease the <hi>Netherland</hi> broyles in the beginning, had sent the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> with Forces into those parts; and after his arriual there, sent him a supply of 600000. crownes; some affirme it to haue beene 800000, She ceized vpon his money in the vvest part of <hi>England;</hi> and hauing got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it vnder her hands, did therewith assist his <hi>Netherland Rebels,</hi> vvhereby this money ordained to haue serued himselfe against his Rebels, came to serue his Rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and bred besides this a farre greater incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience: for it was the cause why the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> demaunded the tenth penie of the country peoples goods, whereby they became the more alienated and apt to Rebellion.</p>
               <p>Some yeeres after this, Captaine <hi>Drake</hi> was employed from <hi>England</hi> to the vvest-<hi>Indies,</hi> vvhere hee robbed the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> of about a million and an halfe of his treasure. These and sundry other wrongs and detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were done by the said Queene vnto the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> at such time as either had their Ambassadours, the ministers of peace, in each others countrey, they professing to each other loue and amitie: the King of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:177717:32"/>
                  <hi>Spaine</hi> doing against the Queene of <hi>England</hi> no act whatsoeuer to the contrarie, whereas shee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise continued to doe against him vnderhand as many wrongs as shee could, besides those great notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wrongs here mentioned. But when these grew so frequent, that the smart vnto the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> became intolerable; and so manifested vnto the world, that all other Princes and people tooke notice thereof, how was it possible that it could stand with the honor of a King, and of such a potent King as is a King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> still to continue to put vp wrongs, as fast as shee continued to doe them? hee was therefore at the last mooued with the preparation of his great <hi>Armada nauall</hi> of the yeere of our Lord 1588. the memory whereof, by the inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant clamors of <hi>puritanicall enemies of peace,</hi> hath possessed more place in the heades of the inconsiderate vulgar multitude, then the many great wrongs that inforced it.</p>
               <p>But thankes bee to God, our peacefull King <hi>Iames</hi> comming to the Crowne, and well knowing how mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had passed, did (to the great happines of the Realm) salue vp this sore from further festring, vvhereunto hee found <hi>Spaine</hi> most ready and willing, and well content to let passe and forget all English iniuries. For to giue the <hi>Spaniards</hi> their due, certaine it is, they are men that are not of vnreconciliable and reuengefull natures, nor such long entertainers of desire of reuenge, as some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations are said to be: And this appeareth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly in this Nation more then in others; for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all fore-going hostilitie betweene <hi>Englishmen</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> both by sea and land, and inuasions euen in <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> it selfe, vvhereof people may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine more sensible, then of an vneffectuall <hi>Armada;</hi>

               <p>As for the sundry benefits which the commerce and traffique betweene <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> hath brought vnto our Nation, I doubt not but many of our Merchants, sea faring men and others will confesse, and farre more profit and benefite will no doubt ensue the most hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and great alliance now expected.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to our good neighbours and friends the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and consider of the gratefull goodnesse and benefits which we reape by them, that thereby wee may know how well and wisely wee are aduised to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme them for our good neighbours and friends, and so friendly sticking vnto them.</p>
               <p>That we haue for aboue these fifty yeeres taken their parts is sufficiently knowne; that the people of <hi>England</hi> haue oftentimes generally smarted by the great pressures and parliamentall payments imposed vpon them by Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to vphold these friends and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours withall, is likewise well enough knowne; as also that great aboundance of <hi>English</hi> bloud hath beene shed in their quarrell, and an infinit number of Englishmens liues lost, vvhose courage and valour was worthy of more honour, then in their base and dishonourable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice could be deserued; and now when all comes to all, they are so farre from honest ciuilitie, that they will not acknowledge any friendship done them, and therefore can they not entertaine any thoughts of obligation or gratitude; nay, they dare plainely tell vs, that wee are
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:177717:33"/> beholding vnto them, which is as much to say, that they expect gratitude at our hands.</p>

               <p>You long to breake your malice vpon Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> and will goe farre about, and much out of the way to doe it, you should not otherwise shew your selfe a right <hi>Romane Catholike,</hi> or a right <hi>Spanish Papist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For our ancient Leagues with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> which you mention, we confesse it; but you must consider, then both States were vassals to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and <hi>England</hi> was then accounted by that <hi>Strumpet</hi> the elder brother. Now <hi>Spaine</hi> hath got priority, and vve haue so much vvit as to know the iniury offered vs, and to acknowledge our heauenly progeny, renouncing that earthly bastardie; and therfore must looke for opposition from the Prince of this world, and all that take part with him. Besides, then <hi>Spaine</hi> was not so potent, and so not so formidable; the accesse of so many Kingdomes hath since possest him with a more imperious spirit, and made him terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his neighbours and confederates, rather then (as he had vvont to be) helpefull vnto them.</p>
               <p>The quarrell betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> you cast wholly vpon Queene <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and by the vvay, blame her for suffering Artillerie and Munition to bee caried out of her Land to the <hi>Moores of Granado,</hi> and for ceizing vpon a great summe of money belonging to the King of <hi>Spayne,</hi> vvhich fell vpon her coast. Then you huddle vp that vvhich Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> did against the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> making the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Melchisedec,</hi> or king of <hi>peace and iustice,</hi> to stand still all the vvhile in a maiden-like posture, and neuer lift vp his hand to defend himselfe and annoy <hi>her,</hi> till in 88. he

               <p>Concerning that which you say of the good vse our Ambassadors haue receiued in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the iniuries the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadors haue receiued in <hi>England:</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, first you see the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadour was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded out of <hi>Spayne</hi> for his Religion sake; vvhilst all the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadors haue had free exercise of their superstitions in <hi>England,</hi> and liberty to corrupt others; so as none are barred from hearing of their Masses, but all things done as publikely as in <hi>Spaine.</hi> Besides, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had an Ambassadour that plotted treason in <hi>Spaine,</hi> but the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> hath had such in <hi>England;</hi> as namely, <hi>Dom Bernardin of Mendoza,</hi> who thereupon was chased out of the Land like a spie, and tooke not leaue like an Ambassador. The Chronicles of <hi>Spaine</hi> cannot
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:177717:35"/> accuse any of our Ambassadors to haue medled farther, then in the protection of Merchants, or discharge of duties and commands proper to their places: but how farre the Ambassadours of <hi>Spaine</hi> haue intruded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the affaires of <hi>England,</hi> for the aduancement of the <hi>Romish Religion,</hi> and disposing Offices for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, is so notorious to the people, as it is no maruell, if they haue suffered some indignities; nay, it is a wonder they haue runne no farther hazard. I make no question had the like actions beene vndertaken in <hi>Spaine</hi> against the <hi>Romish Religion,</hi> by an English Ambassadour, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Clergie of <hi>Spaine</hi> would haue stoned him out, and the people would scarce haue suffered him to passe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished, perhaps though the King himselfe would haue beene his protector.</p>
               <p>The benefits of our commerce, especially by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected <hi>alliance</hi> you speake of, the successe will manifest; and we haue great cause to hope it may be good, at least better then it is, in regard wiser heads haue the handling of it, then either yours or mine: and yet I must tell you, we begin with no good <hi>omen</hi> hitherto, since by way of preuention, our Clothes, Stuffes, and English commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of Wooll are excluded, vvhereby the gaines wee get by the <hi>alliance,</hi> vvill soone be drawne home againe; Princes delighting to out-reach one another in these respects of State. Had wee once beene as wise to keepe our <hi>sheepe</hi> from thence; or were we now as warie to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish their <hi>Silkes, Veluets, Tobacco,</hi> and other needlesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities from hence, then wee might hap indeed to gaine by the Trading, otherwise we may put the gaine in our eyes. But the Customes would so bee lessened; nay rather let the Commonwealth sinke.</p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:177717:35"/>
               <p>For the <hi>Netherlands</hi> ingratitude, I cannot accuse them, neither vvill I excuse them: I know many old and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Commanders, who haue lost their bloud and bones in their quarrell, complaine of neglect, contempt, and forgetfulnesse of former good turnes; and perhaps there is too much cause of their complaint: but for my parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as I fight for them, so I haue my meanes from them, and should be taxed of ingratitude my selfe, if I should taxe them of vvhat I know not, or feele not. Souldiers haue neuer the happinesse to bee well rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or vvorthily regarded as they ought in any place; the reason perhaps is, because their employment is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome euen to those that employ them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though necessitie procure their entertainment, yet that compulsion, together with the person, is alike vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull. Looke into <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and all great States, how they haue vsed their owne, and then you vvill not so much vvonder, that the idle, vnexperienced, and most inconsiderate sort of people in these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, vse strangers no better. Men are apt to bury ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny benefits vnder the ruines of one iniurie: and the West-winde from our Coast, blowes not so fauourable a gale vpon this as it had wont; neither doe the Starres from our Firmament, cast vpon them so happy an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and fruitfull influence, as heretofore: they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot dissemble the alteration, but shew it also in the alteration of their lookes towards vs.</p>
               <p>Another reason vvhy we receiue no better vse, may be the buying and selling of <hi>Places;</hi> of which, vvhen the <hi>States</hi> haue taken notice, as of Offices valuable at high rates, they haue inquired into the secret vvayes of that gaine, and haue abridged it vvhat they could. Whereas,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:177717:36"/> if preferment might haue proceeded the right way in any reasonable manner, according to the law of Armes and Armies, that is, <hi>freely</hi> to the next successor as <hi>heire</hi> to his predecessor; or to the <hi>best deseruer,</hi> as purchaser by personall <hi>woorth</hi> and <hi>valour,</hi> then neither should the Souldier complaine of his Officer, or the Officer of the <hi>State:</hi> whereas now the price is euer in the eye of the Commander, that he may gather vp his money speedily by exaction, vvhich he hath disbursed, lest it proue too deare a bargaine; and it is also in the eye of the <hi>State,</hi> causing them to imagine the Commanders profit to be farre more then it is, for vvhich he venters so much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and his life to boot, as if hee intended to buy dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>Another reason may be, that the <hi>State</hi> takes the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer and the Souldier to be incorporated into their Body; now vvhen naturally (of all people in the world) they loue frugalitie, (euen so farre, as often it turnes into a vice in many) they beholding the contrarie prodigalitie of our people, especially in apparel and diet, aboue their rankes and abilities, doe dis-affect them as vnnaturall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uergrowne members to that spare Body; not conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that brauety is tolerable in Souldiers, if it be so in any profession. I doe not meane that courtly and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate brauerie of perfuming and powdring; (as they vse to doe, who would keepe corrupt flesh from tayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) a Souldier neuer smels sweeter, and lookes better, no not in the eye of a Lady, then when he is perfumed vvith sweat, and powdred with dust, and painted or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smeared with bloud: nor yet doe I meane that beastly brauery, wherein the golden-spangled Asse struts, and thinkes himselfe better then the man that rules him and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:177717:36"/> rides him; but that brauery in <hi>action</hi> (whilst euen the outward shew is not affected nor neglected) which made<note n="*" place="margin">This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded for their glory, and others imitation, by the renowned Souldier Sir Roger Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams, who was one of those that brought this kinde of brauerie into fashion.</note> Sir <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Baskeruile</hi> (to mention no more) so notable in the eye of the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> and his Army; when maintaining a breach furiously as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted, the one was knowne by the skarlet Cassocke dyed deeper yet in his owne and enemies bloud, and the other by his white Scarfe and Fether, worne as markes for his enuious and emulous enemies to shoote at in vaine, beeing aboue their reach. Now this brauery (which is truely their owne) may aswell bee performed in Buffe and Broad-cloath, as in all the anticke imbro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deries, and apish inuentions of our idle Age: and this brauerie is not contemned, but procures them honour and respect, vshers them into the company of best Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Peeres, makes their waies easie in the greatest presse and crowd; attracts all eyes to gaze vpon them, though clad in rust and copwebs; yea the more torne, and rent, and tattered, scarified and mutilated euen to deformity, the more faire, and glorious, and admirable they shine both in the eyes of this Nation, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if they be honorable, though they be enemies.</p>
               <p>Besides, that brauerie in clothes, as it is euer borrowed of beasts, birds, fishes, and wormes, so it is often bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, or taken vp in trust of poore men; and this must needes mooue hate and enuie, when the Souldier pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth by with the Merchants wealth on his backe, and he in the meane time, his wife &amp; children must fare hard, goe thrid-bare, and at last breake for lacke of payment, except by complaint he get redresse; which nips the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall debtor also, and causeth him to fret, rage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, as if the iniury were done him, because hee is not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:177717:37"/> suffered to doe what iniurie hee would, and by his idle excesse to vndoe the industrious Merchant and Artizan, of which this Common-wealth principally consisteth. Now this his profuse prodigalitie makes others (though sober) thought the worse of, and so to receiue the harder measure and censure at all hands, as if it were not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall and speciall fault, but a generall disposition of the Nation, vvhich is a great mistake in this matter.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the censorious <hi>Cato's</hi> of that Commonwealth, seeing not onely themselues by trust, but also their youth spoiled by the example and conuersation of these ouer-reaching Gallants; and that now their sonnes and daughters begin to reuell away their estates; to shackle and manacle, to bridle and saddle themselues in silkes and veluets, in gold and siluer, and to waxe wearie of that ancient and commendable frugality, which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines their liberty, must needes hate those that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold to be the cause of this vanitie, vvhich threatneth and introduceth slauerie: especially when they see it proceedes from the imitation of the <hi>French, English,</hi> and <hi>Scottish</hi> Nations, who were first called in by their vertue and valour, to be the bulwards and walles of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; but now pull downe with the left hand, what they built with the right, laying open by their Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifrian pride, a breach wide enough for the wrath of God, and politique power of ambitious man, to enter in front for their destruction,</p>
               <p>These or some of these may be the causes, vvhy the modester and better sort (whereof there are many) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no better vse, being mixt with bad deseruers; and vvhy (perhaps) they seeme to bee hated, or at least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respected, euen of those for whom they fight, and vvho
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:177717:37"/> ought to prosecute them vvith all honorable attributes, reuerent respects, and ample rewards.</p>
               <p>But howsoeuer, if we compare their vse of vs, vvith the vse you haue and doe finde vnder the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> they will appeare most gratefull and respectfull people. How basely doe all the <hi>English</hi> vvaite vpon the <hi>Spanish Dons,</hi> as if all Nations vvere bound to fight for the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> by a duty of nature? You are promised mountaines at the first entertainment, but are payed with a bit and a knocke as Apes deserue. We haue lesse promised, but that is surely payed, though sometime something slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. When the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> is runne farre in debt to any troupes, the Generals know how (like good husbands for their Masters profit) to put such troupes vpon some desperate seruice, where few may come off: nay, they vse to force them on vpon such vnassaultable and impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable vvorkes, as appeared in the siege of <hi>Bergen.</hi> So the great <hi>Turke</hi> vseth to take townes, by filling vp ditches vvith his owne men. And this is generally obserued as a difference betwixt our Generals and yours; your Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals care not how many men they lose to saue money; our Generall cares not what mony he spends in making vvorkes for the sauing of his souldiers liues vpon appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The difference of our accommodation is such, as we neuer vvant victuall, and you almost euer want it: so that euery souldier with vs, is, or may be (if his owne idlenes or ryot be not in the fault) better prouided, then the Commanders with you. This appeared before <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> where 1500. of your side came running to vs, driuen by meete necessity, for lacke of meat or pay; of vvhich number, though most were <hi>English,</hi> yet there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of all Nations; as <hi>Walloons, Dutch, Italians,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:177717:38"/> Yea I my selfe saw at <hi>Rees,</hi> a seruant of the Earle of <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domare,</hi> the late <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadour, running away in his Liuerie, to the English Beefe and Brewesse: and if such as he, so commended, fared so hardly, vvhat shall vve thinke of other friendlesse people?</p>
               <p>And if the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> should say (as you report) that vve tooke their parts partly for our owne sakes, they should say nothing but truth, and it concernes vs so to doe; yet this diminisheth not the cause of their grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; for as in tennis the ball must be tost to and fro; so amongst friends, benefits and gratitudes must be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed, or else amitie ceaseth, or perhaps dieth or tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to enmitie. It concernes vs both equally therefore to keepe this ball vp, if we intend to continue gamesters long; for assuredly vvere these Countries reduced to such termes as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> desires, vve could not be safe, but might certainly expect a present inuasion; and so might they expect suddenly to be swallowed vp, if ours were enemie.

               <p>But I must tell you further concerning the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that they doe not only deny all gratitude where it is due, and vniustly claime it vvhere they owe it; but passing further beyond the limits of reason and humanity, they discouer themselues to be such monsters, as to beare a very deuillish hatred both vnto our Nation, and to our most gracious Soueraigne himself: Against our Nation, their actions declare it; against our Soueraigne, their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous tongues.

               <p>The iniuries and abuses offered to our Nation in <hi>Mos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couy, Groonland,</hi> and the east-<hi>Indies,</hi> vvere not the acts of the <hi>State,</hi> but of some wicked persons, who wearie of their owne welfare, would as gladly haue the King of <hi>Spayne</hi> their Master againe as you, or any other <hi>Spanish</hi> Pentioner could wish. I know that the baser and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler sort of these, being mungrell <hi>Spaniards</hi> in affection, and perhaps in bloud, vvhere they get the vpper hand, are as mercilesse as <hi>Moores</hi> or <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and like them (being ouercome) are as humble, seruile, and deiected.</p>
               <p>But vvhat meane you to mention this? vvhen all the iniuries they haue done vs, though they be great, incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, intolerable, vnworthy that they should inflict them, or vve suffer them, yet they are nothing to that vvhich the Kings <hi>children</hi> haue suffered by a <hi>Spanish</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. Here priuate Merchants, or a Societie, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie receiued iniurie by them, There the Kings <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:177717:40"/> Religion, the Reformed Church, suffered ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, by the insulting, cruell, and bloudy <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and many thousands of Christians were martyred after a barbarous and butcherly manner; yea vpon all aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, euen vnder tearmes of Treatie and Peace. And this vvhilst <hi>Spaine</hi> had league vvith our State, yea whilst the Townes vvere vnder our Kings protection; vvhilst the Army vvas payed by our King, and the Generals hands bound for attempting against them, yea almost from defending himselfe; and vvhilst an Ambassadour lay vpon purpose to make their entrance more easie, and to grant what their ambitious humours could desire, in hope vvith kinde vsage to glut their vnsatiable gorges, and to force them reciprocally to returne some solide and reall (besides complementall and verball) courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies: yea vvhilst they vvere kissing the one cheeke of our King, they vvere smiting the other; kissing the Prince, as if they meant to deifie him, and giue him all theirs; smiting his royall, louing, and onely Sister, and by force taking away all that vvas Hers.</p>
               <p>For that vvhich you say concerning the <hi>Netherland</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillers drawing away our Gold, and destroying our Trafficke, I acknowledge it to be partly true, yet I doubt the <hi>Romish locusts,</hi> those <hi>Babylonish Merchants</hi> spoken of <hi>Reuel. 9.</hi> and <hi>18.</hi> are more in fault in those respects, then the <hi>Netherlandish</hi> caterpillers. If vve consider the pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the vnder-hand gatherings, the maintenance giuen towards Schooles and Seminaries in all Popish Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, euen out of <hi>England;</hi> the building of Nunneries, Monasteries, and other irreligious Houses; the <hi>hee</hi> and <hi>shee</hi> Votaries, that of late dayes (especially since the Proclamation commanded the contrarie) haue carried
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:177717:40"/> out their plentifull portions thither, you will easily iudge, that the caterpiller hath not cropt our blooming fruit of <hi>Hesperides,</hi> so much as the <hi>locust;</hi> and so by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, spirituall merchandizing in Idolatrie, hath more hindred our Trade, then the vnder-hand pettie thefts (in comparison of the other) committed by a few pedling and pilfering Merchants. And all men know, decay of Trade necessarily and naturally followes the decay of Coyne: so the spirituall traffique of <hi>Rome</hi> hath more decayed our Trade in all Countries, then the temporall trading of <hi>Amsterdam.</hi> For I haue credibly heard related from the mouth of a worthy witnesse, that at one time there hath beene payed 200000. pounds in <hi>English</hi> gold in to one of those spirituall Bankes, for and toward the building and repairing of certaine Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and payment of portions, and other allowances for such of the <hi>English,</hi> as haue entred into religious Orders; for they will take none empty-handed; and vvhat they take is with a <hi>mort-main,</hi> whereas the Merchant yet trades, and returnes something againe that hath sauour. I produce this one payment, not as if it were all, but that by this one notable transportation of <hi>English</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, we may guesse at many others vnknowne. Besides, with what disaduantage our Merchants trade <hi>by reason of Religion,</hi> and how this also deads their dealings, making them obnoxious to the couetous <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and so a prey to their pleasures, all the world knowes.</p>
               <p>I am glad to heare you so angry with those varlets that betwixt <hi>Rotterdam</hi> and the <hi>Haghe</hi> spake ill of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie: The case is either alterd with you since father <hi>Parsons</hi> died, or else perhaps you thinke it becomes none to rayle but men of your Religion; you forget the

All these are forgotten, or by you past by, though their sweet remembrance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines still with many, as the snuffe of a candle new put out.</p>
               <p>As for the Bores you speake of, they are as wide mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed as you; their throats open sepulchres, their tongues stretcht out vpon the largest Last, and in the midst of their cups and Tobacco, will forget the honour of God and man, caring no more to raile at a Prince being out of his reach, then you do to blaspheme God himselfe, when a Priest stands at your elbow ready to absolue you; nor to draw their kniues vpon you beeing inraged with drinke, then you vpon Kings, made drunke before vvith the cup of the <hi>Whores abomination.</hi> But this must not be made a fault of a whole Nation, no more then your personall follies shall be imputed to all <hi>Romane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques;</hi> nor must wee for a drunken Skippers tongue, leaue the protection of our more modest friends and neighbours, vvith whom these are mixed, as base earth amongst gold-Ore; such a resolution were madnesse, and vvould require a purge of <hi>Hellebore</hi> indeed, as you learnedly aduise; though your aduice, if it were vvise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed, would be to the great hinderance of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Trade, that we in <hi>England</hi> should giue ouer To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,

               <p>Lastly, where you demand <hi>what detriment we endure by the Spaniard,</hi> and <hi>where they binde vs hand and foote, and cast vs ouer Indian rockes like dogs, &amp;c.</hi> I am forced for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to touch vpon two or three strange and stupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stories, amongst infinite others left behinde as ill or worse, thereby to giue your blinde and wilfull partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie some satisfaction.</p>

               <p>About twelue or fourteene yeeres since, there was a ship sent from <hi>London</hi> called the <hi>Vlysses,</hi> to <hi>Trinidado</hi> to trade for Tobacco; vvhich our Merchants had wont to doe, in the time that <hi>Berea</hi> gouerned there: but at this time the gouernement vvas changed, <hi>Berea</hi> beeing sent vnto <hi>Mexico,</hi> and those parts gouerned by the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Officers. The Merchants and Owners of this ship thinking they might trade peaceably as they vvere wont, shot off a piece of Ordinance according to the custome, to signifie their arriuall, and desire to trade as they vsed to doe; vpon vvhich the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came to the shores side, shewing out their vvhite Flagges in token of peace: and our Merchants so assured, after the manner of all Nations that beleeue a God, or loue men like

               <p>About two yeeres after, a ship of <hi>South-hampton</hi> came thither, the Merchant of which named <hi>Chamberlaine,</hi> had beene there the yere before, and there was owing to him an hundred pounds of Tobacco: hee, making no question but all had beene well, leaped ashore to trade with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and was presently taken, and his throat cut in the sight of them that were in the Boate, vvho hardly scaped.</p>
               <p>In that Apologie written by Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> a little before his death, he shewed, how the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:177717:43"/> did tye the <hi>English</hi> (out of a ship wherein M. <hi>Hall</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and him selfe were partners) backe to backe, and cut their throats after they had traded with them a whole moneth, and trayned them ashore in trust of their fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, vvithout so much as a sword or any other weapon amongst them all to defend themselues. And if (saith he) the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to our complaint made answere, that there was nothing in the Treatie against our Trading in the <hi>Indies,</hi> but that we might trade <hi>at our perills,</hi> I trust to God (saith he) the word <hi>perill</hi> shall euer be construed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently to both Nations, <hi>otherwise wee must for euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the Indies, and close all our knowledge and pilotage in that part of the world.</hi> Thus hee: And how vnreasonable this is, euen such as looke into the Map of <hi>America,</hi> may judge at first sight. <hi>America</hi> is more then the fourth part of the knowne world, the hundreth part whereof is neither possest nor knowne by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who wants men to people what hee hath grasped already. Why then should not our King employ his numerous Nations that way, for the strengthening and enriching of his owne State; enlarging the bounds of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and spreading of the Gospel with freedome? espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering, as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> lackes men for his land, so the King lackes land for his men, vvho therfore are forced to people <hi>Poland, Sweden, Denmarke, Germanie, France,</hi> and to range in those and other parts, as if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

She tooke their part, partly for compassion; she neither knew them Rebels, nor counted them so; but if she hated the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> then must there be cause why she hated him; and hating him, she had reason to fauour and foster those that hated him aswell as her selfe, or rather that were hated by him as she herselfe was.</p>

               <p>That there were diuers conspiracies of treason in her sisters time is euident, that she was apprehended, and put in prison vpon them is euident; that she was the only hope and obiect of the conspirators is euident, and that some of them accused her, is also euident: for Religion her troubles were not, because she made profession of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of her sister, and daily heard Masse: some cause there must be of her apprehension, which must also be some great cause: for no<note n="*" place="margin">I returne your owne interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: was neuer any apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and imprisoned without cause to be the Queenes siiter &amp; next heire to the crowne, is cause e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to worke iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie and suspicion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Princes, who will take an easy occasion to imprison their Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</note>

               <p>Therefore I shall not neede to thinke vpon this point long, as if what you sayd were vnanswerable: Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> herselfe hath saued me a labour, where in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to an infamous libell written against her in <hi>Italian,</hi> which chargeth her with vnthankfulnes to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who (as the authour reporteth, being a man of your minde) in her sisters Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time, had saued her life, she saith, <hi>That her faith and fidelity was neuer in any such question in her sisters time, and much lesse that euer any sentence of death was pronounced against her, and that therefore he had no cause why to seeke to saue her life: Confessing and ingeniously acknowledging neuerthelesse, that she was as then somewhat beholden vnto him, and that in all princely and honorable manner she had been thankfull vnto him for the same.</hi>

               <p>You first pretend, our Gospel, and that Gospel which is preached and professed in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> differ, because there is difference betweene Protestants and Puritans in <hi>England;</hi> for so you are pleased to style such true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians as protest against your falshoods, and would reforme your impurities in life and doctrine, <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans.</hi> How well this hangs together, the premisses and conclusion, you cannot but see, and smile to behold, being a man so merily disposed by nature as you seeme. But you demand, how contention should otherwise arise amongst vs? why else should some bee silenced or bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed? Doe the difference betwixt Iesuites and secular Priests in <hi>England</hi> proue their Gospels differ? Doubtlesse their <hi>Portuces</hi> are the very same: why doe the <hi>Thomists</hi> and <hi>Scotists</hi> differ? Is their Gospel diuerse? why doe the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Franciscans</hi> pursue each other with deadly quarrels, is it because their Gospel differs? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse many of these know not the Gospel; most of them care not for it; nay, let me say boldly, few of them prize it, as they doe that which they call their <hi>vnwritten veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> or <hi>traditionall Gospel,</hi> whereabout yet they fall out with eagernesse. And had not the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> cunningly trust vp all their trinkets, and taught them what they must hold, none could haue known what it had beene
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:177717:48"/> to be a Papist: But Antichrist then vnsealed the secrets of his Mysterie;<note place="margin">Apoc. 13.16 17.</note> for then it was a time for him to discouer himselfe, that such as tooke <hi>his marke on their foreheads, or in their hands,</hi> might be knowne for counterfeit Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
               <p>You demand, if our differences be small, why then are some silenced, some banished. some put to death? Iniurie may be done somtime vnder the colour of iustice; and <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> may be forced euen by <hi>David</hi> himselfe,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 16.3. 2.

Sometime also many iust occasions may prouoke such seuere punishments to be inflicted v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon persons for circumstantiall poynts, though they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not in fundamentall verities contayned in the Gospel. But tell me in good earnest, why were the Iesuites bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed <hi>France,</hi> and a pillar set vp to eternize the memorie of their banishment, was it for that their Gospel differed from the <hi>French</hi> Church? Or why were the Iesuites ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished out of <hi>Venice?</hi> or why are the Cardinals iealous to make a Iesuite Pope?

Thus yours also not knowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, their owne basenesse, vilenesse and vnworthinesse, seeke perfection in themselues, and through spirituall pride ship-wracke their owne soules, and the soules of such as depend vpon their rotten principles. Amongst the <hi>Ethnikes</hi> there were diuers Sects of Philosophers, which were their wise men, &amp; supposed themselues more perfect then the rest. The <hi>Academickes,</hi> such are your Iesuites: the <hi>Stoickes,</hi> such are your preaching Friars: the <hi>Peripatetickes,</hi> such are your begging Friars: the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures,</hi> such are your Popes, Cardinals, Bishops, and rich Abbots.

               <p>A third Argument you bring to proue our Gospel and theirs differ, and that wee seeke to defend a wrong Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, seeking to defend theirs. The reason, for their Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel allowes of theft.</p>
               <p>If it be so, we disclaime their Gospel and the cause also; marke the solide proofe therefore.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Netherlands</hi> steale whole Prouinces from the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> whilst they hang theeues for trifles, and that by their Gospels warrant, for so it must be, or you say nothing.

               <p>But if they be theeues and steale Prouinces from <hi>Spaine;</hi> How hath <hi>Spaine</hi> gotten superioritie ouer his neighbour-Nations? how hath he made many intrusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vpon <hi>Savoy, Nauarre, France, Italy?</hi> How vpon the East and West <hi>Indies?</hi> How vpon <hi>Ireland,</hi> and how v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>England</hi> also, whose purse he would haue taken, whilst you and yours were setters and plotters for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase? Is he a thiefe for this? Is this Catholike doctrine? I feare you must passe vnder the rod of penance for this ouer-sight. Remember what the Pirate said to <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great: I am a Pirate and a thiefe robbing with one ship, and taking away a little; and because thou robst the whole world with a Nauie and an Armie, thou art styled an Emperour. <hi>Indian</hi> gold is able to purchase many more able flatterers and supporters, then you are.

               <p>That which remaines is matter of controuersie in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which you haue propounded at pleasure, making me a very simple fellow fit to be coopled with you for company in the answers annexed by you: Yet that which you propound is such stuffe, and so followed, as you need not protest your selfe to be no Diuine; you bewray it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently in your Discourse, though otherwise I might haue doubted a Priest or Iesuite (as they had wont) might haue lurked vnder a buffe Ierkin, a red scarfe and feather. And indeed though I acknowledge there are many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men on your side, yet me thinkes such kind of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is a matter superfluous, and leading towards here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:177717:51"/> for since that infallible spirit of decision, direction, and exposition is in your Popes brest, what need other Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, then such simple and illiterate persons as Christ first chose to be his Apostles, and to plant his Church, since there remaines in your Church still extraordinarie and primarie power to dispose of the spirit miraculously, and so to bestow the gifts of tongues and miracles, as it was with Christ himselfe, and his Apostles after? For which cause your Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> is called the Apostolique Sea, from whence all that supernaturall power is deriued, as from an ordinarie Minister or Vicar appointed by Christ to that end. But to leaue this still in doubt, come to your Diuinitie: Two points you insist vpon: The <hi>Eucharist,</hi> &amp; <hi>auricular Confession:</hi> In speaking of these, you labor to justifie your owne doctrine &amp; practise, and disproue ours.</p>
               <p>You first labour to free your selfe from Idolatrie, and say, If Christs body be not truly in the Masse, that is, as you vnderstand it, if the bread be not truly transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated into the bodie of Christ, then you doe not intend any worship to it, and so you commit no Idolatrie.</p>

               <p>Againe, your worship which wee now speake of being the exterior reuerence of the body, must be for the Ideots satisfaction aswell as for the greatest Clerkes: for it is S. <hi>Paules</hi> Argument against publique vse of an <hi>vnknowne tongue</hi> in the Church, especially in preaching, or prayer: <hi>If when the the whole Church is come together in one,</hi>

               <p>You build vpon Christs words who cannot deceiue, and is sufficient to performe what he speakes: and he hath said, The bread is his bodie, and were it still bread, (say you) yet he hauing said, it was his bodie, and you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing it to be so, he cannot condemne you of mis-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe: for if he had neuer said it, you had neuer beleeued it.</p>
               <p>We acknowledge Christs truth and power: but here we looke to what he did and said, and do not with you presume to change his words or workes: He neither said, the bread was transubstantiated into his bodie, nor did he will his Apostles, or their successors to worship it, but to take and eate it, and doe it in remembrance of him. Christ said, <hi>This is my bodie:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 22.19.</note> we say so too with him and with you: The difference is about the manner of his presence: You say, the bread remaines not, though you see, feele, taste bread: We say, Christs bodie is taken and eaten by the soule of the faithfull, whilst his hand takes, &amp; mouth eates the bread. So it is his body (as he intended) though bread remaines; bread really, his body Sacramentally and Spiritually, both truly. Christ as concerning his bodily
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:177717:53"/> presence is in heauen at the right hand of God the Father, so we are taught to beleeue; and from thence as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning locall decession, shall not come, till he comes in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to iudge the quicke and dead: this we see confirmed, Act. 3.21. <hi>Whom the heauens must receiue, vntill the time of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of his holy Prophets, since the world began.</hi> And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.<hi>28.

Then looke for a figuratiue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of these words, and for a spirituall eating of Christ, or else you denie your Creed, and contradict S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and Christ himselfe; <hi>for the flesh profiteth nothing,</hi> Ioh. 6.63. <hi>It is the Spirit that quickeneth;</hi> not the literall, but the spirituall vnderstanding and eating nourisheth the Spirit. That which the bodie eates, cannot benefite the soule, that which the soule eates cannot nourish the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. The bodie eates bread; the soule, Christ; the one by the teeth, the other, by faith: both are thus nourished according to their seuerall natures and essences. If you will not grant a figure in these words, what say you to those that follow immediatly as part of this Sacrament?<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.13</note>

And if you grant a figure in this, why not in the former? the same Christ spake both, the same Christ is able alike, the same Christ wils me to doe both in remembrance of him, and

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:177717:54"/> nor of the wine withdrawne from the people, nor of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation or adoration, but all done as we doe it, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Christs death, by way of thankfull acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the benefit wrought for mankind thereby. All the rest is of your owne inuention, superstitious, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, antichristian.</p>
               <p>Looke the place and it will confirme you in all these plaine and euident truthes: for they tooke the Sacrament at their loue-feastes, so far then from superstitious adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they were irreverend and almost prophane in not discerning betwixt that, being a religious action, a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall meate, and other ciuill actions and corporall meates: wherefore the Apostle reduceth them to the primitiue institution, far from mad Idolatry and drunken prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in christian sobriety as becomes persons made worthy partakers of so great a Mystery.</p>
               <p>That which you adde to auoide your Idolatry, as if the reuerence you doe to your Idoll in the Masse, were no more then what we in the presence shew to the Kings chaire of State, is ridiculous. Our reuerence is ciuill, yours is religious: all men, yea the simplest old wife can distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish ours from a religious act of worship to God; it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples your greatest Doctors to cleare your point in the Schooles by imaginarie distinctions; how then in actions they shall be distinguished, especially when they are to be performed by an old ignorant woman, it will trouble a man no lesse wise then your selfe to imagine, much more to manifest.</p>
               <p>That which S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith of <hi>Images, being Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens bookes,</hi> is concerning their historicall vse; but we see they haue taught the people so many lies, that if <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> were now aliue, he would barre them both from preaching and praying in the Church too. For if a <hi>woman</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:177717:55"/> be forbidden to be a teacher there, I know not why a <hi>dumbe Idoll</hi> should be there admitted to teach.<note place="margin">Zach. 11.15.17.</note> I presume, both the pretence and intent of the first introducers was good, to banish heathen Idols, to please the new conuerts with something sutable to their olde superstitions; but we see the euill successe of this, and of all other points of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Policie, of worldly wisdom intermixt with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, either directly against, or simply without the authoritie of the word of God it self, how it brings cōfusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; helps in the issue to pul down <hi>Siō,</hi> &amp; build vp <hi>Babel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last point you handle is <hi>auricular confession;</hi> for which you bring a proofe from Scripture: The proofe is Christs generall commission giuen to the Apostles and their Successours, <hi>Receiue the Holy Ghost, whose sinnes you shall forgiue,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 20.20.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>1.</note>
                  <hi>they are forgiuen; and whose sinnes you shall retayne, they are retayned.</hi> But here you leaue out what Christ spake to them before, namely, <hi>As my Father sent me, so send I you.</hi> Christ was sent to forgiue sinnes, not by hearing <hi>auricular Confession,</hi> but by preaching the Gospel of Repentance, from dead workes and faith in Gods promises made in him; and so sent he his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, not to heare priuate confessions, but to publish the Gospel for remission of sinnes, and sauing poore repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and beleeuing soules, who made publique confession of their sinnes, as the Apostles did publiquely preach re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and confession.</p>
               <p>You bring in also the example of <hi>Iohn Baptist, Mat. 3.</hi>6. Where the people are said to come out to him to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, confessing their sinnes; which makes nothing for your purpose, to prooue <hi>auricular Confession,</hi> but shewes how glad you would be to finde shelter to couer your nakednesse in the garden of God, when your owne figge-leaues will not serue your turne.</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:177717:55"/>
               <p>The truth is, they that came to be baptized publikely, were publikely to acknowledge that guilt &amp; sinne which they would haue washed away, and remitted by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme: for before the receipt of cure, they were to know and acknowledge themselues sicke; but all this was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and generall, not priuately and particularly whispered into Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> eare, as you vse and imagine. A Monke of your owne confesseth this;<note place="margin">Dionis. Cart. Mat. 3.6.</note> For then (saith he) was not the Sacrament of <hi>auricular confession</hi> instituted by Christ.</p>
               <p>We allow confession, and our Preachers doe often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it, what they may, vpon the bleeding conscience, vnable to stanch her owne wounds. But herein is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt you and vs: 1. Yours is of necessitie, ours voluntarie. 2. Yours requires an exact numeration, ours saith with <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 19.<hi>12: Who vnderstandeth his faults?</hi> Therefore we seeke to haue those confessed, which notwithstanding our former confessing to God, we finde still to leaue a sting behind. 3. Yours is full of supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if the worke wrought, that is, the confession of the sinner, &amp; absolution of the Confessor, were sufficient to assure saluation; when with vs there is no remission, but by the free grace of God alone. 4. Lastly, yours is horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly abused, to vnlocke the secrets of Princes, to rule ouer the consciences of men, (for I am master ouer that man, whose naturall inclination I vnderstand, and know how to rule him by his vices, which are constant and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, better then by his vertues, which are no fauourites, and are also seldome at home.) Yea, this hath beene, and is too often vsed, to deflowre Virgins and Matrons, and to to perpetrate and faciliate other darke and blacke actions, for which cause it was banished <hi>Constantinople</hi> by <hi>Necta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> the Bishop there, and is worthy to be banished all Christian Common-wealths: for by this alone, hauing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:177717:56"/> either the Prince himselfe, or any of his neere seruants or his wife, or any of theirs, vnder your imperious fingers, you know cunningly how to open the closest cabinet of secret counsell; and to make a superstitious and trembling soule your instrument to say, sweare, reueale, conceale, whatsoeuer you command, that may be for the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of your Catholike cause. And so euery Priest is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute priuie Councellor.</p>
               <p>But you haue taken an oath to conceale all secrets de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered <hi>sub sigillo confessionis.</hi> Indeed this must needs se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure all men; I had forgotten this. Yet now I remember me, you may be absolued and dispensed withall, if you should reueale any secret deliuered in confession: Besides, you haue taken an oath first, to conceale nothing that may be prejudiciall to the Romane Catholike Religion, but to reueale all that may aduance it, or any way concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes it. Now the first oath bindes, and assoiles the latter, which is but secundarie, and with subordinate respects.</p>
               <p>And for matter of meere conscience, howsoeuer world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wisedome would thinke, and you say, that <hi>auricular Confession</hi> serues to bridle sinne by shame, it is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; my experience knowes, that it makes men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men impudent, so that they care not at last who knowes or sees their filthinesse. I haue seene the written confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of some before they were sent to their Confessors, and that without the least touch of modestie, or sence of shame in the impudent penitents, when I haue blushed to reade those horrible crimes, which they gloried to iterate, both in confessing and committing interchangeably.</p>
               <p>Thus our new-converted Gallants (who neuer had a God before, till now that they haue gotten him about their neckes, and in their Tobacco-boxes) can goe to a Play, and from thence to a baudie-house, and from thence
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:177717:56"/> in a morning to <hi>confession</hi> and <hi>Masse:</hi> and thus make themselues new men, that is, of men, monsters euery day. And this is the onely reason, they so easily turne to be yours; because, though your confessing, and penance, and whipping, and haire-cloth shirts seeme strange things, and make a faire shew at first blush; yet they are nothing in comparison of leauing those sweet sinnes whereunto we haue beene accustomed; and betaking our selues to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and reformed courses, without which our Preachers say, and shew plainely by Scripture, that there is no hope of saluation. And this is the reason our Libertines easily turne Papists; (though you cry out against vs, and call vs Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, because we professe the libertie of the Gospel, from your<note n="*" place="margin">Our soone to the their best soone turne to vs. When you be at the best, you are neerest vs, and when we be at the worst, wee are neerest you.</note> Iewish ceremonies and superstitions) and this is the cause your honestest Professors, who are not intangled and kept backe by honours, or pleasures, or profit, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane respects, are easily induced to be ours, without which they cannot be Christs and Gods.</p>
               <p>The rest that remaines of yours, is such extrauagant stuffe, as shall need no other answere then silence and contempt, which I shall still vse both towards you, and all others that take your part in this subject, or shall audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously reply on your behalfe. Assuring your selfe, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all you can say, many of the English who are yours in Religion, doe assist the States in their warres with body and goods, both in regard of the iustnesse of the cause which you impugne, and the necessitie they see of vpholding them, or falling our selues with them to Spanish subiection and slauerie, which they are not such traitors to permit; howsoeuer you, and such as you wish it. And for our owne, I meane, such as are reformed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes indeed, they laugh at all that you say, as knowing the truth much better, then to be mis-led by iuggling. And
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:177717:57"/> therefore you see how easily they are drawne to goe ouer with me to serue the <hi>States General,</hi> when you haue lien long in <hi>London,</hi> and spent much money, &amp; promised large meanes, (much more then you meane euer to performe) yet goe ouer weakely prouided; and such as you carrie, you haue gotten by faining your selfe to be for vs, &amp; now hold by force, or they would now leaue you, and come to vs. But the best is, you put the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> to booteles cost to carrie them ouer for vs at his charge: for within this three moneths we shall haue all that are left aliue, come to vs, for bread, or meanes, or their Passes. And for such as are with vs alreadie, all that you haue; or can say, doth but rather cause them to binde themselues more close together, for the cunning and industrie they see vsed on all sides to diuide and seuer them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this (I doubt not) will moue the wisdome of the <hi>States General,</hi> and his <hi>Excellencie,</hi> seeing our people at home so well affected to their Cause and Countrey, and the Commanders and Souldiers so sure and trustie to them, (as persons interested in the same quarrell) to vse them not as meere mercenarie and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie Souldiers, but nobly, freely, and bountifully as Natiues; who though they take pay, as their owne, for meere necessitie, (<hi>for vvho goeth to vvarfarre at his ovvne charge?</hi>
